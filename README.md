## Retrospectives

### 12/19/2022 Sprint 2: Backend SetUp and Front End Staging

During this sprint, the team successfully set up the schema, endpoints, and use auth for the project. They also began work on some front-end code, including routes and forms. However, some front-end features, such as sign-in and ticket creation, were not completed by the end of the sprint. The team plans to have these features connected to the database by the presentation on Wednesday.

Overall, the team communicated well and met regularly to ensure progress was being made. However, they may consider setting meeting times on the calendar for a more clear way of communicating in the future.

### 01/07/2023 Sprint 3: FrontEnd and Backend Connections

This sprint, the team successfully built the front-end applications and connected them to the backend, including registration, signup, sign-in, ticket submissions, and project submissions. They are now focusing on tidying up the design of the site, implementing the sign-out button, and cleaning up the UI in preparation for the final presentation.

The team discussed canceling development on the messaging app to refocus on building a few templates to be shown on the website.

## Bugs/Challenges to Address

- Responsive design complications
- Signout functionality
