Sprint2: BackEnd SetUp and Front End Staging  
---------------------------------------------

This sprint we did a great job setting up the steps needed to be done for 
the period and where we would like to be. tus far we have set up  the schema, 
endpoints, useauth, and started work on  some of the front end code (routes and setting up forms and pages).  Currently  we are at the end of the sprint and just  getting to accessing the user data from  the client side to get some working features on the front end but this is incomplete as of this moment.  The plan will be to have the sign  in, ticket creation,  and registration connected to the database by presentation  on Wednesday. 

As a whole members met to make sure we were all getting where we needed to be. there was communication  on  when  we could meet as well  as check ins on  what was working and where we needed to go next.  Tim and Pete were able to get alot of work  done with the endpoints and use auth for sign in. While communication was present on the next planning we may consider setting meeting times on the calender for a more clear way of communicating so there is clarity on what each  member should be doing after a certain task  is done. Each  work  schedule is different and may lead to difficulties as we approach Front end testing and building. 

Next time, it wil likely be more clear cut now that  we have gotten to the point ofwhere the base responsibilities are built.  
Current Decisions for next time: 

Tim - To work on  Registration  and sign in pages functionality
Pete - to work on Projects and tasks components for the User Dashboard 
Destiny - To implement a functioning message board of sorts. 

Together: Decide on  method for state management and color scheme for the site. 

Bugs/challenges to address: 

- Admin accounts vs Client Accounts
- Will there be a Admin  Dashboard in  long term?
- We will need to add conditionals to render some minor parts of the page in  different ways bassed on  the signed in status and id. 
- Will there be time for a templates page with  some of the other tasks needed?
